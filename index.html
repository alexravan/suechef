<h1>Testing Our App (Leg 4) (10/31/16)</h1>
       
<p> For leg 4, we underwent a series of various testing methods to improve our app. First were the required methods, Lint and
    Crashlytics. You can read about our experience with Lint in-depth below. Crashlytics was a much less involved process, it
    was simply to register for and install, and relatively simple to use as well. We made sure it was working correctly by 
    coding in a test button that forced the app to crash. So far we have not encountered any actual crashes since beginning 
    using it, but we trust that it will prove quite useful in the future. </p>
        
<p> Our two other methods were usability tests and . For the usability tests, we each had a couple friends open the app up
    and try to navigate through it. We asked them if it behaved as they expected, if any functionality felt awkward, and if
    the flow of the app was natural. We recieved not quite as much feedback as we had hoped, but certain responses were put
    into action immediately. For example, several users noted that they expected the ingredients and directions lists to be 
    expanded by default when they enter the recipe view. This was not the way we had it, as we felt users may not realize 
    that there was more information to be found below. But upon realizing that this behavior was not what users expected, we
    made the change and are satisfied with the outcome. </p>

<h1>Using Lint to Clean Our Code (10/27/16)</h1>

<p>In our limited experience of Android, we've encountered a lot of Android particularities: strings shouldn't be hardcoded, certain functions may raise NullPointerException, alignParentLeft should be replaced with alignParentStart, among many other things.</p>

<p>Using Lint was surprising easy and pleasant. Just as described, Lint served as our much needed nit-picky code reviewer. It gave us around 100 code "errors" to fix, and a lot of the time Lint would fix it for us if we simply let it. For each of the issues, Lint gave very descriptive messages about why it should be fixed and the multiple methods to go about resolving it.</p>

<p>We spent about 40 minutes reading through Lint messages and letting it fix the bugs for us. Before and after Lint reports can be seen on our GitHub repo.</p>

<p>We've since continued adding on to our project, so we likely will need to run Lint again in the near future. Stay tuned for our update on incorporating CMUSphinx and API.ai.</p>

<h1>Scraping for Recipes &amp; Flask (10/20/16)</h1>

<p>Because the BigOven API requires a paid account, we have been loking for an alternative to sourcing recipes.</p>

<p>We found an API that can parse a recipe if given a URL to a recipe that follows schema.org's or microformats.org's HTML recipe standards.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/kcmoffat/recipe-api">https://github.com/kcmoffat/recipe-api</a>

<p>We looked into a few different sites for sourcing recipes and settled on <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/">epicurious.com</a></p>

<p>To get URLs of recipes, we're using a python script with lxml to scrape epicurious for the URL of the most recent recipes.</p>

<p>Since we'll be scraping with this python script as well as doing some natural language processing, we've decided to switch to a Flask backend to serve recipes to the app.</p>

<h1>MVP Features and Next Steps (10/13/16)</h1>

<p>We put our heads down and squeezed out an MVP today. We implemented all of the features that we aimed for last week, including a step-by-step view, called the StepsActivity, and a recipe overview activity, called the RecipeActivity.</p>

<p>In StepsActivity, the user can use buttons to navigate through the recipe directions. As the user moves forward or backward in the recipe, the app uses the Android text-to-speech feature to dictate the recipes.</p>

<p>The team also implemented several design aspects of Material Design. We used a floating action button in RecipeActivity and applied a color theme, following <a href="https://material.google.com/style/color.html">Android's Material Design color guidelines</a>. Since red and white are reminiscent of food (think checkered recipe quilts), we chose to use related shades of red.</p>

<p>While we call this the MVP, we are missing some crucial features that we hope to resolve in the coming weeks. For one, all recipes are currently hardcoded into the app. We've had trouble finding recipe APIs that fit our needs, as a lot of APIs aren't free, don't have cooking directions, or have directions that are way too long. Ideally, we need an API that gives us recipes in array form with one or two sentences max per step. Since we couldn't find an API, we haven't built the server. We happened to stumble across <a href="https://github.com/kcmoffat/recipe-api">this recipe scraper API</a> found on GitHub, so we likely will be using this for recipes until we find a more appropriate API to consume</p>

<p>For two, the main appeal of this app will be its voice recognition. Users will be interested in talking to their cooking assistant, Sue, but as it is right now, users have to press buttons to have Sue talk to them. As conversation is one-sided, the app in its current state doesn't have much wow factor. We hope to tackle that soon.</p>

<h1><a id="sue-chef" class="anchor" href="#sue-chef" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Moving Towards an MVP (10/6/16)</h1>
    
<p>
   This week we made some preliminary decisions regarding the building blocks we wanted to use, as well as began to think 
   about moving towards an MVP. The APIs we had been thinking about (such as Wit.ai and BigOven) seemed to not fit our needs
   as well as we initially hoped, so we made the switch to Api.ai and Yummly. However, these API decisions were moved to the
   backburner as we began to think more about what was strictly necessary for an MVP. We decided on what features were truly 
   <i>core</i> to SueChef and began implementing only those. The foundational pieces we decided on are: recipe overview, 
   recipe step-by-step view, and text-to-speech during the step-by-step view. This means we cut (for now) features like 
   speech recognition, recipe finding, and social interactions. 
</p>
<p>
   Once these decisions were made, we began work implementing these core features. We decided to use dummy data for a 
   recipe instead of a real recipe for now, so that we did not have to figure out both an API and how to manage the data
   from it at the same time. This piece by piece approach is much more practical and disciplined than attempting to 
   build all parts of a feature simultaneously. 
</p>
<p>
   We have made decent progress towards our MVP already and will continue towards that goal for next week. In the meantime, check out the three activities we have so far.

<h1><a id="sue-chef" class="anchor" href="#sue-chef" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beginning the Development Phase (9/29/16)</h1>

<p>
   This week we began the early stages of development. Progress is slow as we continue to familiarize ourselves
   with Android development, and more time is spent 'experimenting' than actually putting together finalized code. 
   This is of course a necessary phase in the development cycle, but it can feel arduous at times.
</p>
        
<p> Next week we will continue exploring Android development, and progress towards a bare-bones skeleton for our app. </p>

<h1><a id="sue-chef" class="anchor" href="#sue-chef" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Further Thoughts on the Tech Behind SueChef (9/23/16)</h1>


<p>The team is still studying up on Android development. While we are still learning the technicals, we've done a lot of brainstorming
on the technologies we can incorporate into the product.</p>

<p>As discussed in our previous blog entry, CMUSphinx will be a necessity for keyword spotting. Without it, users will have to press a button to turn on their microphones, essentially ruining the purpose of SueChef.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot use CMUSphinx for its speech recognition and speech parsing abilities as we'd have to set up our own language models and dictionaries. As an alternative, we decided to incorporate Wit.ai. It has both speech recognition and speech parsing through a REST API. As Venturebeat says, "thanks to companies like Wit.ai, even kids at hackathons are showing off weekend projects that are voice-controlled." This should speed up our development.</p>

<p>If you took a look at our mockups, image display, especially in grid layouts, will be integral to the design of our app. We are looking to incorporate Picasso, an Android library for image downloading and caching. It will make user experience a lot more responsive and take care of a lot of the headaches that come from layouts.</p>

<p>We're looking to start development in the next week.</p>
